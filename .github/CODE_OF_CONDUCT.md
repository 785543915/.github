# Code of Conduct

This is a project of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org)
and follows the ASF [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct).

If you observe behavior that violates those rules please follow the [ASF reporting guidelines](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct#reporting-guidelines).
{code}

This will ensure that a path to the ASF-wide code of conduct is displayed on all ASF projects on GitHub, unless a project has chosen to create their own such file to display instead.
